# Network Slicing Engine
This ensures QoS configuration defined in the Descriptors provided by the NFVO.

# Technical Requirements
This section covers the requirements that must be met by the environment in order to satisfy the demands of the network-slicing-engine:

* installed and configured Open Baton NFVO/gVNFM (>=2.1.3)
* installed and configured Openstack (>=Mitaka)

# How to install Network Slicing Engine

Quick installation process:
```
$ mkdir /opt/openbaton
$ cd /opt/openbaton
$ git clone https://github.com/openbaton/network-slicing-engine
$ cd network-slicing-engine
$ ./network-slicing-engine.sh compile init
$ # then configure the properties file to suit your setup in regards of nfvo and rabbitmq
$ $EDITOR /etc/openbaton/network-slicing-engine.properties
$ ./network-slicing-engine.sh start
$ # to attach and see the logging output
$ screen -x openbaton
```

# How to use Network Slicing Engine
The currently only supported driver is neutron, which will use the native QoS capabilities of Openstack. To use it simply set ```networkslicingengine.driver=neutron``` in the configuration file. To set QoS policies in your NSD specify the following QoS parameter in the virtual_link of your vnfd configuration. 

```
  "virtual_link":[
    {
      "name":"NAME_OF_THE_NETWORK",
      "qos":[
        "minimum_bandwith:BRONZE"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

# What is Open Baton?

Open Baton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification and the TOSCA Standard.

Open Baton provides multiple mechanisms for interoperating with different VNFM vendor solutions. It has a modular archiecture which can be easily extended for supporting additional use cases. 

It integrates with OpenStack as standard de-facto VIM implementation, and provides a driver mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using the provided Generic VNFM and Juju VNFM, or integrating additional specific VNFMs. It provides several mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with external VNFMs. 

It can be combined with additional components (Monitoring, Fault Management, Autoscaling, and Network Slicing Engine) for building a unique MANO comprehensive solution.
